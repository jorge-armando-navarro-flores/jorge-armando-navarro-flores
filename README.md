I am an enthusiastic student of information technologies.

I love coding anywhere
I am a good self-learner so I constantly look for coding courses in various fields.

I have a special interest in mobile applications and artificial intelligence above all in new and great technologies like flutter, python, and tensorflow so I am actually taking courses about these themes.

I really think that technology is a fantastic way of improving the world
